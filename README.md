## YouTC

[YouTC](https://youtc.netlify.com) is a web application that integrates Twitch Chat with the YouTube video player. The YouTube video player has features, such as fast-forwarding and rewinding using the arrow keys, going to a specific time during the stream, and pausing the stream, which cannot be done on the Twitch stream player. YouTC allows you to replay moments during the YouTube live stream you may have missed, while keeping the ability to interact with Twitch Chat.
